# Notes from Thomas

This was a random passion project I started to help me visualize/validate character creation for a cool TTRPG called Tales from the Loop. This game is not an open game license game so I am limited in how I can distribute this and as such this repository will likely remain private.

I've always felt that using technology is the best way to learn it. Having not used React much over the last couple of years I used this project (and a couple of others) to re-introduce myself to React and all of its friends. Some items of particular focus while working on this project include:

* useState and useEffect
* useCallback
* BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route ()
* Controlled Inputs
* Local Storage
* Tailwind UI
* Zustand state management

Historically, I have been more comfortable with Angular and Bootstrap so I used this project as a means to try a couple of different tools at the same time. Similarly, I've worked on another TTRPG game tool for Vaesen using React and ChakraUI.

There are a few known issues that I tinker with when I have time.

I've gotten some help debugging issues with adding Zustand from Matt Dyer. He is alright.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
